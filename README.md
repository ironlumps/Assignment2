Assignment #2

The files that are being submitted are Game.h, Game.cpp, and main.cpp. 

The problems that are we ran into are many. Our reading from a file function was causing too many errors, and anytime we tried to fix it we ran into more errors, so we decided to scrap the function, so the program can't read from a file. The file also has problems writing to a file because it gave errors saying that all my other classes didn't exist so I commented the lines out. Along with that mirror mode was not finished, so that mode cannot be played. Sorry in advance.
